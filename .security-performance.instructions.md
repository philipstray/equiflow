# Security and Performance Guidelines

Apply the [general coding guidelines](./.general-coding.instructions.md) to all code.

## Security Best Practices
- Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Never log sensitive information (passwords, tokens, PII)
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement rate limiting on API endpoints
- Validate file uploads thoroughly (type, size, content)

## Authentication & Authorization
- Always verify JWT tokens server-side
- Implement proper session management
- Use secure, httpOnly cookies for sensitive data
- Implement proper logout functionality that clears all sessions
- Use principle of least privilege for user permissions
- Implement multi-factor authentication for admin users

## Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Implement proper data retention policies
- Follow GDPR/privacy regulations for user data
- Use signed URLs for temporary file access
- Implement audit logging for sensitive operations

## Performance Optimization
- Use React.memo for expensive component renders
- Implement proper code splitting and lazy loading
- Optimize images and use appropriate formats
- Use CDN for static assets
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Monitor and optimize bundle sizes
- Use service workers for offline functionality

## Monitoring and Observability
- Implement structured logging with correlation IDs
- Use performance monitoring tools
- Set up error tracking and alerting
- Monitor key business metrics
- Implement health checks for all services
- Use distributed tracing for complex operations

## Edge Computing Considerations
- Keep Worker scripts under size limits
- Use KV storage for frequently accessed data
- Implement proper cache invalidation strategies
- Consider cold start impacts on performance
- Use Durable Objects for stateful operations when needed
