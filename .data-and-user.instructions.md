# Project coding standards for Data Handling and User Accounts and Subscriptions

Apply the [general coding guidelines](./.general-coding.instructions.md) to all code.

## Data Handling and Fetching
- Cloudflare D1 is used for database storage
- Use drizzle for creating and managing database schemas and migrations
- Use drizzle ORM and useQuery for database operations
- If a table has a tenantId, ALWAYS filter by tenantId in queries
- User Images and files are stored in Cloudflare R2 with tenant filtering.
- Prefer tombstone pattern for soft deletes. 
  - Use a `deletedAt` timestamp column to indicate soft deletion
  - Always filter out soft-deleted records in queries
- Use `useMutation` for data mutations
- Always handle loading and error states in components

### Data Validation and Types
- Use Zod schemas for all data validation at API boundaries
- Define separate types for database entities, API inputs, and UI state
- Always validate data before database operations
- Use branded types for IDs to prevent mixing different entity IDs

### Caching Strategy
- Leverage React Query's caching for GET operations
- Use optimistic updates for mutations when appropriate
- Set appropriate stale times based on data freshness requirements
- Implement background refetching for critical data

### Database Best Practices
- Use transactions for operations that affect multiple tables
- Implement proper indexing for frequently queried columns
- Use prepared statements for parameterized queries
- Batch operations when possible to reduce database round trips
- Always include `createdAt` and `updatedAt` timestamps

### UUID Strategy
- Use **UUID V4** for core business entities (contacts, companies, deals, users)
  - Provides better security through unpredictability
  - Prevents enumeration attacks across tenants
  - Good for entities referenced by external systems
- Use **UUID V7** for temporally-ordered data (activities, audit logs, events, files)
  - Maintains chronological ordering for better database performance
  - Reduces B-tree fragmentation and improves insert performance
  - Enables efficient time-range queries
  - Better for tables that grow large and are frequently queried by time
- Always use branded types for UUID fields to prevent mixing different entity IDs
- Include tenant isolation in all UUID-based queries

### UUID Storage Optimization (D1/SQLite)
- Store UUIDs as **BLOB(16)** in production for maximum efficiency (56% space savings)
- Use conversion utilities to transform between string UUIDs (app) and BLOB (database)
- Consider TEXT(32) compact format as middle ground (no hyphens, still readable)
- Use full TEXT(36) format during development for easier debugging
- Implement migration strategy when moving from string to BLOB storage

### File Storage (R2)
- Use consistent naming conventions for file keys
- Include tenant isolation in file paths: `tenant/{tenantId}/...`
- Implement proper file type validation and size limits
- Use signed URLs for secure file access
- Clean up orphaned files regularly

## User Accounts, Authentication, Authorization and Subscriptions
- We use WorkOs for user accounts, authentication, and authorization
- Use WorkOs for managing user sessions and permissions
- Use Stripe for payment processing and subscriptions
- Active user and session data is stored in Cloudflare KV. 
  - Subscription and Session status is monitored and KV is updated accordingly
  - KV is queried on every data fetch to ensure the user is active and has a valid subscription

### Authentication Patterns
- Always validate authentication tokens on sensitive operations
- Implement middleware for route-level authorization checks
- Cache user permissions in KV with appropriate TTL
- Use role-based access control (RBAC) for granular permissions

### Subscription Management
- Check subscription status before allowing premium features
- Implement graceful degradation for expired subscriptions
- Use webhooks to handle real-time subscription updates
- Store billing metadata in encrypted format
