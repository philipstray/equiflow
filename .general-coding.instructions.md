# Project general coding standards

## Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for component names, interfaces, and type aliases
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods
- Prefix private class members with underscore (_)
- Use ALL_CAPS for constants
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate purpose
- Avoid abbreviations unless they are widely understood
- Use verb-noun pattern for functions: `getUserById`, `createPost`

## Error Handling
- Use neverthrow result types for all operations where errors can occur. If a module might throw or return errors, wrap it in a Result type.
- Implement proper error boundaries in React components
- Always log errors with contextual information. If an error affects the user experience or requires user action, display a user-friendly message. Never expose raw error messages to users or anything that could compromise security.
- Define specific error types for different failure scenarios
- Use Result.match() or if/else patterns instead of try/catch
- Chain operations using Result.map() and Result.andThen()

## Code Organization
- Follow feature-based folder structure
- Keep components small and focused on single responsibility
- Extract custom hooks for reusable logic
- Use barrel exports (index.ts) for clean imports
- Separate business logic from UI logic

## Performance Guidelines
- Implement proper memoization with React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback
- Use lazy loading for routes and heavy components
- Optimize bundle size with dynamic imports
- Avoid prop drilling - use context or state management when needed

## Type Safety
- Prefer type assertions only when absolutely necessary
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Define union types for finite sets of values
- Use branded types for domain-specific values (IDs, etc.)
- Always type function parameters and return values
