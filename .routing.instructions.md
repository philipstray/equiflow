# Routing Guidelines for TanStack Router

Apply the [general coding guidelines](./.general-coding.instructions.md) and [React guidelines](./.react-typescript.instructions.md) to all code.

## TanStack Router Integration
- Use TanStack Router for all client-side routing
- Leverage type-safe route definitions and parameters
- Integrate router loaders with React Query for data fetching
- Use search params for filterable/sortable data tables
- Implement proper error boundaries for route-level error handling

## Route Organization
- Use file-based routing for better organization
- Group related routes in feature folders
- Implement nested layouts for consistent UI structure
- Use route guards for authentication and authorization
- Define route metadata for breadcrumbs and navigation

## Data Loading Patterns
- Use route loaders with React Query integration
- Implement proper loading states and error boundaries
- Cache route data appropriately with React Query
- Use optimistic updates for navigation state
- Handle authentication state in router context

## URL State Management
- Use search params for table filters and pagination
- Implement type-safe search param validation with Zod
- Sync URL state with component state bidirectionally
- Use router state for modal and drawer management
- Implement deep linking for all user states

## Performance Optimization
- Implement route-based code splitting
- Use lazy loading for heavy components and features
- Preload routes on hover for better UX
- Optimize bundle splitting by route
- Use router prefetching for predicted navigation

## Navigation Patterns
- Implement consistent navigation components
- Use programmatic navigation with type safety
- Handle navigation state (loading, errors)
- Implement breadcrumb navigation
- Use router events for analytics and tracking

## Route Security
- Validate route parameters with Zod schemas
- Implement proper authentication checks in loaders
- Use route-level permission validation
- Handle unauthorized access gracefully
- Implement tenant isolation in route context
