# UI/UX and Component Guidelines

Apply the [general coding guidelines](./.general-coding.instructions.md) to all code.

## Component Design Principles
- Build components that are reusable and composable
- Use compound components pattern for complex UI elements
- Implement proper accessibility (a11y) attributes
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Use semantic HTML elements when possible

## Styling Guidelines
- Use CSS-in-JS or CSS modules for component-scoped styles
- Implement a consistent design system with tokens
- Use CSS custom properties for theming
- Follow BEM methodology for CSS class naming if using global CSS
- Ensure sufficient color contrast for accessibility

## State Management
- Keep component state local when possible
- Lift state up only when multiple components need access
- Use React Query for server state management
- Use Context API sparingly - prefer composition
- Implement optimistic updates for better UX

## Loading and Error States
- Always provide loading indicators for async operations
- Implement skeleton screens for better perceived performance
- Show meaningful error messages with recovery actions
- Use suspense boundaries for code-splitting
- Provide offline state indicators when applicable

## Form Handling
- Use controlled components for form inputs
- Implement proper form validation with clear error messages
- Provide real-time validation feedback when appropriate
- Use proper input types for better mobile experience
- Implement proper focus management for accessibility

## User Experience
- Implement proper feedback for user actions
- Use consistent interaction patterns throughout the app
- Provide undo functionality for destructive actions
- Implement proper navigation and routing
- Use progressive disclosure to avoid overwhelming users
