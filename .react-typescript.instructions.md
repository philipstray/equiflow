# Project coding standards for TypeScript and React

Apply the [general coding guidelines](./.general-coding.instructions.md) to all code.

## TypeScript Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow functional programming principles where possible
- Use interfaces for data structures and type definitions
- Prefer immutable data (const, readonly)
- Use optional chaining (?.) and nullish coalescing (??) operators

## React Guidelines
- Use functional components with hooks
- Always use pure functions for components
- Always separate logic and data fetching from UI components
- Prefer Promises as props for UI components with use(propsPromise) hook
- Make use of Suspense and lazy loading for code splitting
- Follow the React hooks rules (no conditional hooks)
- Use React.FC type for components with children
- Keep components small and focused
- Prefer shadcn components for UI elements
- Use tailwindcss for styling and always use OKLCH color space
